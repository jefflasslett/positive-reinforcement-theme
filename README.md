# My emac colour scheme: positive-reinforcement

This is my colour scheme.  I’ve used something like it for most of my career.
The basic idea is that undesirable things like C preprocessor and literal
values are in ugly colours (purple, red).  Good things like comments and other
code are highlighted in pleasing colours (green, blues, cyan, gray).  It’s all
on a black background for good contrast.
